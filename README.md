I saw that such geojson is nowhere to be found. 

In https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:boundary%3Dadministrative?utm_source=chatgpt.com#Slovenia in admin-level == 4 for Slovenia it says:
"reserved for regional borders - if they are ever finalized (SL: pokrajine)"
So I guess Slovenians are yet to update borders of their homeland for OSM.

I created this geojson so it can be useful for my personal project - CastleHunters.eu.

Not sure if values for "nuts" are correct though. I found incoherent data in that matter.
